:chart: The Watch List widget is available in the [Trading Terminal](Trading-Terminal).

You can select the default symbols for the WatchList and make it read-only if needed using the [widgetbar](Widget-Constructor#widgetbar) field of the Widget Constructor.

There is also a [powerful API](Widget-Methods#chart-watchlist) to change the WatchList on the fly.
